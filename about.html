    <h1>MAGICAL MEMORIES</h1>
    <p>"Matter" in arts is just synonymous with "subject". That might be an attempt to depict an emotion through visual medium or more literally, a building.

        "Form" is one of the Elements of art. Also called "shape". Alternately, the word might also be used to discuss the entirety of the elements of art used in the composition.
        
        I rarely use the word form when thinking about photography.

        Content on the other hand can be the “form/visible shapes” of the things within the “framing” of my photograph.
